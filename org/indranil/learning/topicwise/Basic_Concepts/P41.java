//Question : Write a program to read a number and display whether it is Perfect Number or not.
//In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, 
//that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). 
//Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors 
//(including itself) i.e. Ïƒ1(n) = 2n.
//The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. 
//Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The 
//next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128
//Ans      : See Below.
